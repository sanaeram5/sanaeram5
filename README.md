<h3 align="center">Full Stack Web Developer | Content writer | Poet | Avid reader | Ambivert </h3>

I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Application Developer by the day and a Poet by night. I enjoy exploring various domains and technologies. I spend time learning new tech related stuffs and love to juggle between them. I perform best under pressure.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **developing myself as an individual**.
- 💻 I’m currently learning **Gatsby**.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on **ML and AI web-based projects**.
- 💬 Ask me about **Books and technology**... And I can go on without any halt😅
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am very clumsy and lazy
